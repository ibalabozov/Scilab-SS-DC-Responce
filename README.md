# Scilab-SS-DC-Responce
This is a Special Software to Predict the First Order Dynamic Circuit Steady State DC Response within a Limited Set of Experimental Data. It is made through Scilab software.
Scilab is an open-source alternative of MATLAB. More information about the Scilab can be found here: https://www.scilab.org/

The developed software application is part of a scientific work entitled "A Special Software to Predict the First Order Dynamic Circuit Steady State DC Response within a Limited Set of Experimental Data", with authors Denitsa DARZHANOVA, Iosko BALABOZOV and Petar DARJANOV. The work is presented in 22nd International Symposium on Electrical Apparatus and Technologies SIELA 2022 (https://siela.tu-sofia.bg/) and will be published in IEEE Xplore Digital Library (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/).
